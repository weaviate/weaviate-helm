    title: "RAFT Snapshots (v1.28.13+, v1.29.5+, v1.30.2+)"
    message: "CAUTION FOR DOWNGRADES: Multi-node instances of Weaviate running `1.28.13+`, `1.29.5+`, or `1.30.2+` may experience problems if downgraded to a `v1.27.x` version earlier than `1.27.26`. The cluster may not reach a **Ready** state due to a change in the way that RAFT snapshots are stored in the database. A fix for this issue will be released with `1.27.26`, which safely handles the downgrade path to `1.27`. If you need to downgrade Weaviate to `v1.27.x`, use `1.27.26` or higher."
