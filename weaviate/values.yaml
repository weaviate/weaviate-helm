# Sub Chart Overrides
#
# Weaviate uses sub-charts to manage its backing dependencies (Elatiscsearch,
# Etcd, etc.). You can overwrite any of the values to scale the dependencies.
# Keep in mind that databases are stateful and should be scaled carefully. In
# critical scenarios, such as a production environment, we recommend to perform
# backups before scaling databases.
